## 1. OVERVIEW <span id="section-1"></span>

This Refund Policy shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the English language, regardless of any translations made for any purpose whatsoever.​

All sales are final and no refunds will be issued. If you believe that you deserve a refund, please contact us using our contact information provided below. We reserve the right to accept refunds and returns at our sole discretion. If any of the items listed below apply to your return, it will not be granted:
 - The supply of goods that are made to the consumer’s specifications or are clearly personalized.
 - Sealed goods which were unsealed after delivery and thus aren’t suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons

## 2. WRONG ADDRESS <span id="section-2"></span>
If you provide an address that is considered insufficient by the courier, the shipment will be returned to our facility. You will be liable for reshipment costs once we have confirmed an updated address with you (if and as applicable).

## 3. UNCLAIMED <span id="section-3"></span>
Shipments that go unclaimed are returned to our facility and you will be liable for the cost of a reshipment to yourself (if and as applicable).​
Sale items – only regularly priced items may be refunded

## 4. NO ACCOUNT <span id="section-4"></span>
If you haven’t registered an account on https://anonoei.com and added a billing method, you hereby agree that any returned orders due to the wrong shipping address or a failure to claim the shipment won’t be available for reshipping and will be donated to charity.

## 5. PROVIDERS <span id="section-5"></span>
We use two different product suppliers in order to provide our products: Printful, and Printify. These providers may have different Return Policies, and thus have different requirements for returns. Please contact us using the details above if you believe your return meets our requirements.

### **Printful**
Any claims for misprinted/damaged/defective items must be submitted within 4 weeks after the product has been received. For packages lost in transit, all claims must be submitted no later than 4 weeks after the estimated delivery date. Claims deemed an error on our part are covered at our expense.

If you notice an issue on the products or anything else on the order, provide the details to the contact methods listed above.

Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.

If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.

#### **Late or missing refunds**

If you haven’t received a refund yet:
 1. Check your bank account again
 2. Contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.
 3. Contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.

If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us using the details listed above.

### **Printify**
If there is a problem with an order and/or the received products, please get in touch with us using the contact methods listed above with 30 days of product delivery. If your product is damaged or has a manufacturing error, a free replacement will be provided.

If the order shipping details were incorrect, or if you ordered the wrong size or color, no replacements or refunds can be offered.
